Food Item Recognition and Calorie Estimation

Project Overview

This project involves developing a model to accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. The objective is to enable users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

Dataset

The Food-101 dataset from Kaggle is used for training and evaluation.

Model Architectures

Three different pre-trained deep learning architectures were utilized:

DenseNet201
VGG19
InceptionV3
Project Structure

data/: Directory containing the Food-101 dataset.
models/: Directory to save trained models.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for training and evaluation.
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
results/: Directory to save results such as accuracy plots, loss plots, and confusion matrices.
Usage

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the Food-101 dataset for training and evaluation.
Model Training: Train the models using the pre-trained architectures.
Evaluation: Evaluate the models using accuracy, loss metrics, and confusion matrices.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict food items and estimate their calorie content.
Results

The models were evaluated on the test dataset. The results include accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices to visualize the performance.
